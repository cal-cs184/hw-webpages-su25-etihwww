			<h2>Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

			<h3>Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>

			<p>
				De Casteljau¡¯s algorithm finds a point on a B¨¦zier curve by repeatedly lerping between control points.
				At each step, it creates new points between the existing ones.
				Given \(n\) control points, we can use use linear interpolation to find \(n-1\) new points. To implement
				<code>evaluateStep</code>, I added a helper function<code>lerp</code>, which uses linear interpolation
				to find a point between two values. In <code>evaluteStep</code>, I simply looped through each pair of
				neighboring control points and used <code>lerp</code> to find points in between based on \(t\).
				Then, I collected all these in-between points into a new vector, which contains the next level of control points in the algorithm.
			</p>

			<p>
				Below are screenshots of each level of the evaluation from the original control points down to the final evaluated point.

			<h3>Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
			<p>
				De Casteljau¡¯s algorithm extends to B¨¦zier surfaces by applying the algorithm twice.
				Once parameterized by \(u\), and then in parameterized by \(v\).
				This creates a surface from a grid of control points.
				It¡¯s like doing curve evaluation along one axis, then blending those results along the other.
			</p>

			<p>
				The implementation of <code>BezierPatch::evaluateStep</code> is very similar to part 1, only difference is that we are dealing with 3D points.
				<code>BezierPatch::evaluate1D</code> recursively applies De Casteljau¡¯s algorithm on a list of control points until only one point remains.
				<code>BezierPatch::evaluate</code> first defines a Bezier curve parameterized by
				\(u\) for each row of the \(n*n\) grid of control points
				using De Casteljau¡¯s algorithm,
				giving a list of intermediate points.
				Then it evaluates that list at the parameter \(v\) to compute the final point on the Bezier surface at
				\((u,v)\).

			<h2>Section II: Triangle Meshes and Half-Edge Data Structure</h2>

			<h3>Part 3: Area-weighted vertex normals</h3>


			<p>
				To implement <code>Vertex::normal()</code>, I looped through all adjacent faces of the vertex by traversing all the half edges that
				point outward with <code>halfedge->twin()->next()</code>.
				For each face, I recorded the positions its vertices
				\(v_0, v_1, v_2\), where \(v_0\) is the current vertex.
				I then computed the normal, which is the cross product of \(v_1 - v_0\) and \(v_2 - v_0\).
				Then, I multiplied the normal by the area of the face. Finally, I summed up all the area-weighted normals and normalized
				the result to obtain the vertex normal.

			<h3>Part 4: Edge flip</h3>
			<p>
				To implement <code>HalfedgeMesh::flipEdge</code>, I created a visualization of the mesh structure
				before and after the flip. Then I drew arrows to indicate the directions
				of the halfedges, and labeled all the elements involved. I found the helper function
				<code>Halfedge::setNeighbors</code> really helpful. I looked at the diagram and figured out
				how to reassign the pointers. at first glance,
				it might seem like the edge bc should be deleted.
				However, I found out that all we actually need to do is reassign the next pointers
				of the adjacent halfedges correctly to reflect the new structure.
				For example, the halfedge that e0 points at, should have vertex a as neighbor instead of vertex b.
				It should also be the next of halfedge ca, and its next should point to dc. The next of dc should also
				be reassigned to ca. I reassigned the neighboring elements of all the halfedges according to the diagram
				shown below.


				Then, I reassigned the halfedges for the 2 faces, and verteices
				a and b. vertex a now points to a new halfedge ad after the flip, and b only points to bd. Before the flip, both
				bc and bd point away from vertex b.
			</p>

			</figure>

			<p>
				My debugging journey was not fun, but I learned a lot from it.
				At first, I attempted to reassign every neighboring element of each halfedge
				directly using long pointer chains like <code>halfedge->next()->next()->vertex()</code>
				instead of clearly defining variables like <code>VertexIter vertexA</code>.
				This quickly turned into nearly a hundred lines of messy, unreadable code.
				I had no idea which variable referred to which part of the mesh anymore,
				and the lack of clear naming led to tons of repetitive work.
				UThen the code became impossible to debug,
				and I ended up spending more time deciphering my own code than actually fixing the problem.
				So I threw it all out and started from scratch.
				This time, I named every element clearly, and wrote just the bare minimum needed to flip the edge correctly,
				because I later realized a lot of elements stays unchanged.

			<h3>Part 5: Edge split</h3>
			<p>
				Similar to Edge flip, I drew arrows on a diagram to help me figure out the mesh structure.
				And then, I identified the new elements that needs to be created when performing an edge split.

				<ul>
					<li>6 halfedges: am, ma, bm, md, mb, dm</li>
					<li>1 vertex: m</li>
					<li>2 faces: bottom left, bottom right</li>
					<li>3 edges: m's left, m's right, m's bottom</li>
				</ul>
				And then, I set up all the new vertex, faecs, and edges
				by assigning their halfedge pointers, just like in Edge flip.
				Assigning the neighbors for the halfedges requires a bit more work, but all I had to do
				was making sure every pointers are assigned correctly based on the diagram. For example,
				the old halfedge bc becomes mc, and similarily cb becomes cm.
			</p>

				<img src="section2\part5_1.png" alt="Teapot" style="width:100%" />
				<figcaption>the mesh before and after edge split.</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				I noticed some interesting implementation tricks when implementing edge split.
				<ul>
					<li>
						I grouped the halfedges together by triangle. For example, halfedges
						mc, ca, and am are all inside the upper left face. It helped me organize my code and made it
						more readable. Plus, all of them points to the same face.
					</li>
					<li>
						The old halfedge bc becomes mc, and similarily cb becomes cm. Its like moving the edge bc
						to the top, instead of creating 2 new halfedges.
					</li>
					<li>
						I named my halfedges in a unique way. For example, halfedge mc originates from vertex m (the first letter), and its twin
						is halfedge cm (reverse the letters).
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

				Below are screenshots of before and after edge splits.

			<p>
				Thanks to all the time I spent on fixing my messy code from edge flip,
				I was able to finish edge split pretty quickly. There was one problem I encountered,
				but it was very easy to debug since I groupped the half edges by triangle. I realized I was
				assigning the face pointers wrong. It was easily fixed.

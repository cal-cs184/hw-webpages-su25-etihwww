			<h2>Overview</h2>
			For this project,
			I built a basic rasterizer that can draw and color triangles,
			apply supersampling for smoother edges, handle transforms,
			and map textures with antialiasing.
			The goal was to create a simple vector graphics renderer that can load SVG files and display them accurately.
			By the end, I had a working system that can turn vector shapes into pixel images, similar to how web browsers render SVGs.
			I learned how concepts like barycentric coordinates, supersampling, and mipmaps actually work to produce antialiased images.
			It was really cool to see how combining these techniques directly affects rendering quality.
			<h2>Task 1: Drawing Single-Color Triangles</h2>
			<p>
				First, I defined the bounding box, which contains the triangle and helps limit the number of samples to check.
				It's defined by the mininum and maximum \(x\) and \(y\) verticies, where \(floor(x_{min}, y_{min})\) is the top left of the box, and \(ceiling(x_{max}, y_{max})\) is the bottom right of the box.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then, looping through each point in the rectangle, I checked whether the point <b>p</b> lies within the triangle.
				Because screen sample positions are located at half-integer coordinates in screen space, we need to add 0.5 to the original coordinate.
				To do this, I used the three line test.
				I defined each edge as a line using the equation described in lecture 2,
				where \[ L_i(p_x, p_y) = -(p_x - x_i)*(y_{i+1} - y_i) + (p_y - y_i)*(x_{i+1} - x_i) \]
			</p>
			<p>
				If all three L's are greater than 1, then the point is inside the triangle.
				To draw the triangle regardless of the winding order of the vertices, I included samples where all
				three L's are less than 1.
				I also included points where L is equal to 0 to make sure all the edges are rasterized.
				If the conditions are met, fill in that pixel with the color given.

			<p>Here is an example 2x2 gridlike structure using an HTML table. Each <b>tr</b> is a row and each <b>td</b> is a column in that row. You might find this useful for framing and showing your result images in an organized fashion.</p>


			<h2>Task 2: Antialiasing by Supersampling</h2>
			<p>
				First of all, to support supersampling, I scaled sample_buffer up by sample_rate, because each pixel is divided into sample_rate subsamples.
				I updated RasterizerImp::set_sample_rate() and RasterizerImp::set_framebuffer_target()
				to make sure sample_buffer is resized when needed.

			</p>
			<p>
				In RasterizerImp::resolve_to_framebuffer(), I added 2 inner loops to iterate over the subsamples.
				Because sample_buffer is multiplied by sample_rate, how we map the 2D pixel coordinates (x, y) to a 1D array index should also change.
				I came up with this formula:
				\[ index = ((y * grid\_size + j) * width * (grid\_size)) + (x * grid\_size + i) \]
				where grid_size is the square root of sample_rate.
				To average the colors, I initialized Color col with rgb = 000. In each iteration col is updated by 1.0f/sample_rate of the color of the subsample.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then, I updated RasterizerImp::rasterize_triangle() to support supersampling. First step is to scale the dimensions of the bounding box
				accordingly by grid_size. Then, since the pixel is divided, we also need to recalculate the center, dividing \(p_x + 0.5\)
				and \(p_y + 0.5\) by grid_size.
			</p>
			<p>
				In RasterizerImp::fill_pixel, I changed sample_buffer[y * width + x] to sample_buffer[y * width * grid_size + x] to map the index in sample_buffer
				correctky. I also edited RasterizerImp::rasterize_point, where I just simply filled all the subsamples with the same color.
			</p>
			<h3>Why is supersampling useful?</h3>
			<p>
				Supersampling makes images look smoother by taking multiple color samples per pixel and averaging them.
				This helps reduce jagged edges and noise. For example, the triangles from Task 1 looks jagged and some of them
				are even cut-off, because a pixel only has 2 colors to choose from, for example, either pink or white(which is the background color).
				But as the sample rate goes higher, the edges get smoother, because the color is being averaged from subsamples.

			<h2>Task 3: Transforms</h2>
			<p>
				Look! Cubeman is wearing cal gear and dancing! He's leaping mid-air like an epic superhero! His arms are crossed to make an epic dance move!
				I rotated both his left and right legs clockwise. I rotated his left arm downwards(counterclockwise), and right arm upwards. I also translated his right arm
				to the other side of his body for the epic dance move. Great job, cubeman!

			<h2>Task 4: Barycentric coordinates</h2>
			<p>
				Imagine a triangle with three corners: <b>A, B, and C</b>.
				pick any Vertex <b>V</b> inside the triangle.
				Barycentric coordinates are a way to describe where <b>V</b> is using <b>A, B, and C</b>:
				\[ V = \alpha A + \beta B + \gamma C \]
				where alpha, beta, and gamma are the barycentric coordinates, and
				\[\alpha + \beta + \gamma = 1\]
				Using an image from lecture 5, we can see that the color of V is mostly mixed with blue and green,
				and a little bit of red. This is because V is very far away from A (the red vertex),
				so alpha (the coordinate corresponding to red) becomes very small compared to beta and gamma.

			<h2>Task 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h2>
			<p>
				Pixel sampling is used to map a texture onto screen space pixels.
				Given both the screen-space (x, y) coordinates and texture-space (u, v)
				coordinates of the three triangle vertices,
				we can compute the barycentric coordinates of each pixel inside the triangle.
				These barycentric coordinates are then used to interpolate the (u, v) texture coordinates across
				the triangle surface.
				The interpolated (u, v) at each pixel tells us where to sample the texture,
				and pixel sampling is used to determine the final color. In task 5 I used two pixel sampling techniques: nearest neighbor and bilinear interpolation.
			</p>
			<p>

				Nearest-neighbor sampling selects the texel whose center is closest to the given (u, v) texture coordinate.
				We assume uv coordinates range from 0 to 1, so I checked for bounds and returned Color(1, 0, 1) given in
				starter code for invalid inputs. Then I multiplied them by (width) and (height) to convert to texel space,
				then round to the nearest integer to select the closest texel.

			</p>
			<p>

				Bilinear interpolation, on the other hand,
				blends the colors of the 4 closest texels to get a
				smoother color at a specific (u, v) texture coordinate by
				finding the 4 nearest texels (top left, top right, bottom left, bottom right).
				I defined the lerp function, which blends between two values, as a lambda.
				\[ lerp(x, v0, v1) = v0 + x(v1 - v0)\]
				Use the lerp function on the top2 and bottom2 texels, and blend them at the end to get
				the final color.

			</p>

			<p>
				To implement RasterizerImp::rasterize_textured_triangle, I reused code from
				rasterize_interpolated_color_triangle. Instead of interpolating Color,
				the function interpolates (u, v), then sample the texture using the
				specified pixel sampling methods, nearest or bilinear.
			</p>

			<p>
				Below are screenshots of the  two sampling methods at different sampling rates
				zoomed in on the number '8'. Using nearest, we can see that the edge is chunky and jagged.
				Bilinear, on the other hand, looks smooth and blended. Increasing sample rate does not make a
				big difference with bilinear.

			<h2>Task 6: "Level Sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h2>
			<p>
				Level sampling decides which mipmap level we should use when sampling.
				If a large texture is drawn onto a small screen area, it's very likely to
				get aliasing patterns. Therefore, we pick a smaller mipmap level that matches the screen size
				and filters out high frequency.

			</p>

			<p>
				I implement Texture::sample as stated in the spec, which selects different sampling method
				and levels
				based on the params given. When lsm == L_ZERO, the function samples from level 0, which is the same as task5.
				When lsm == L_NEAREST, the function computes the nearest mipmap level by calling get_level(sp) and rounding it
				to the nearest integer. When lsm == L_LINEAR, mipmap level is computed as a continuous number.
				The weight sum is computed with lerp in task 5.
			</p>

			<p>
				I implemented the helper function, Texture::get_level.
				to decide which mipmap level to use based on how much the texture is stretched on screen.
				By taking the change in UV coordinates between neighboring pixels and
				scaling them by the texture's width and height,
				the function estimates how much texture space one screen pixel covers.
				then take the maximum stretch and apply log2 to get the appropriate mipmap level,
				since each level is half the resolution of the previous.
				Finally, we need to make sure
				the level to stay within the available mipmap levels to avoid invalid access.
			</p>

			<p>
				I also made changes in rasterize_textured_triangle. Unlike in pervious tasks, I needed to
				compute the barycentric coordinates of (x, y), (x + 1, y), and (x, y + 1), and made my code super messy and hard to debug.
				So I added a helper compute_barycentric to organize my code a bit. At the end, I assigned all
				required parameters to a SampleParams struct, and passed it to Texture::sample.
			</p>

			<p>
				Pixel sampling is fast and cheap in memory
				but limited antialiasing power. nearest is sharp but jagged, and
				bilinear is smoother but blurrier.
				Level sampling adds memory by storing downscaled versions of the texture,
				but greatly improves performance and antialiasing power when textures shrink on screen.
				Multiple samples per pixel has the best antialiasing power but at the cost of much higher memory usage.
				So the tradeoff is that the more quality the more speed or memory.
